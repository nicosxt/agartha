# Agartha Mission Paper Draft

Agarthaâ€™s mission is to accelerate the emergence of a decentralized global network of regenerative, resilient and sovereign communities.

We accomplish this mission through research, online community hubs, and in-person events.  

Agartha operate as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) with on-chain governance and representative democracy. This means we let our contributors and community decide on approaches we should take, and areas we should be focusing on. We are a constantly evolving and are defined by our community of contributors. Together we form a living organism with intention and agency.

## Online Gathering

Agartha hosts a website and active discord server to coordinate research, network with community founders and prospective members, and organize events.  

## Research

Agartha researchers are engaging with research questions that could alter the course of society at large. Our team of experts aim to span a diverse range of background and experiences. Agartha research is targeted for actionable outcomes: we aim for the development of best-practices that can actually be implemented today, to create a technological, governance, and economic roadmap for tomorrow.
* What features of communities can out-compete economic systems in default society? 
* What aspects influence the rate of community formation dynamics and community stability?
* How do we structure these communities so that they are distinct improvements on default society as it stands today? 
* What have past and present intentional communities taught us about successful governing structures? What are the do's and don'ts of community governance?
* What are the key bottlenecks preventing a decentralized global network of communities from reaching its global potential?

## In-person Events

Agartha hosts hackathons in M, Texas on an annual basis. Our network of members liason in conferences and rent out locations to brainstorm and learn about the needs of communities by in-person experimentation.
